Sales Data Analysis & Forecasting
Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing historical sales data to uncover trends and patterns across different product lines and payment methods. Utilizing Python's powerful data manipulation (Pandas) and visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn) libraries, along with scikit-learn for Linear Regression forecasting, it provides a comprehensive look at sales performance and predicts future revenues.
Features

Data Loading and Cleaning: Reads sales data, parsing dates appropriately, and prepares it for analysis.

Aggregated Sales Insights: Calculates total and average sales metrics across different dimensions such as payment method and product line.

Visual Analysis: Utilizes bar charts to display sales data, highlighting key trends in payment types and product pricing strategies.

Cross-Metric Assessment: Employs pair plots to explore relationships between various dataset features, offering deeper insights into the data structure.

Time Series Analysis: Analyzes sales over time, presenting both total and cumulative sales trends for each product line.

Sales Forecasting: Applies Linear Regression models to predict future sales revenues until the end of 2021 for each product line.
